<h1>ReActivities</h1>

<p>Welcome to the ReActivities Application repository! This project is currently in the process of being developed, utilizing a combination of .NET Core on the backend and React on the frontend. It aims to create a robust and modern web application that leverages the strengths of both technologies.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>ReActivities Application project combines the power of .NET Core as a server-side framework with React as a client-side library to create a feature-rich and dynamic web application. The backend, built with .NET Core, provides a scalable and performant foundation for handling data processing, business logic, and API integration. The frontend, developed using React, offers a responsive and interactive user interface for seamless user experiences.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
        <li>.NET Core: The backend of the application is built using .NET Core, a cross-platform, high-performance framework for developing web applications.</li>
        <li>Entity Framework (EF): EF is utilized as the object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for database integration and management.</li>
        <li>React: The frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
        <li>Axios: Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, is employed for making API requests and handling data communication between the frontend and backend.</li>
        <li>MobX: MobX is used as the state management library to handle the application's state and ensure efficient rendering and data synchronization.</li>
</ul>
